# 343HW
First Homework in CIS-343-01
This repository is or the first assignment in cis-343, it contains one image showing the Git tutorial completion and one README.md. The readme contains a list of Git commands that I could potentially use.
List:
Git init - enter the git repository, useful at least once every time I access the project I am working on.
Git status - should be used many times throughout the project and multiple times throughout the course a day.
Git commit - this will be used every time I wish to commit something, hopefully multiple times throughout the project so that I don't just have one massive explanation.
Git log - if there are any changes that occur, this will help me find them.
Git branch - when a new branch is necessary, if there are any major changes to be made it is necessary
git merge - when my branch is complete
git push - when the program is complete.
